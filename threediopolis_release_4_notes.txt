Threediopolis release 4 has a few nice fixes. I was able to use Zarf's script to do stability testing, which was a big help, and it also turned up small bugs and inconsistencies in the narrative, which I was able to fix.

Here are the main features:
--header for scenery mode (this was intended to be the only one, but stuff kept popping up)
--Q lets you zoom through areas and avoid random text.
--big headers now only refresh after you find something, so if you play the game in a web browser/slower interpreter, it will slow down less.
--the game now detects how you run out of bounds for a more suitable error message.
