Threediopolis release 4 has a few nice fixes. I was able to use Zarf's script to do stability testing, which was a big help, and it also turned up small bugs and inconsistencies in the narrative, which I was able to fix.

Here are the main features:
--header for scenery mode (this was intended to be the only one, but stuff kept popping up)
--Q lets you zoom through areas and avoid random text.
--big headers now only refresh after you find something, so if you play the game in a web browser/slower interpreter, it will slow down less.
--the game now detects how you run out of bounds for a more suitable error message.
--there are now 100 silly random events, up from 72 in release 3.
--small speedups in traversing (game doesn't search for scenery when there can't be any and also cuts off searching in the table of scenery when no further entries could be seen)
