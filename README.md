# threediopolis

This is my repository for my IFComp 2013 game, Threediopolis, source and walkthroughs/logic docs. It should be relatively stable with the most recent changes as of release 4 on August 14, 2016, and no great changes are expected. Especially since I am near the glulx/z8 threshold.

This game should be runnable with WinFrotz or any windows interpreter. It may not be super fast in a web browser, but it'll be faster than it used to be now that I'm refreshing the top list less.

The most recent release contains headers for the scenery and task parts of the game. The most recent release includes testing with Zarf's regression testing script.
