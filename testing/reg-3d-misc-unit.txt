They remind you the marking will fade in a year.

You can also see Ed's old friends for less regimented hints. HINT again for twistiness.

Twistiness is just the number of unique directions you need to go to find the location, though not the actual bends. So EEW and EWE would have the same twistiness. HINT again tells about spelling.

Man! Someone's front door! With the secret detail Ed Dunn showed you that's obvious once you know it!
>x door
It looks familiar, slightly different from all the identical ones.

odd grassy door

It's greenish-brown, and you're tempted to pick at it to see how naturesome it is, but you'd better not.

It is impressive. It would make you believe in religion, if you hadn't convinced yourself long ago you'd probably pick the wrong one.

You'll have to walk in to see what's so special. Nothing in the windows outside really captures you.

The loading dock is neither exciting nor forbidding. You can probably just ENTER it.

It's kept up well. But it's also narrow enough that if you weren't looking for it, you'd miss it.

The height is just for effect. It doesn't look too heavy to enter.

>x door
It's meant to radiate charm and a simpler life. More practically, it stands out from the cookie-cutter doors around it, so you know you've found the right place.

>x library
It's barred, almost like a jail, which scares away the dumber people. That's a good thing, because dummies often tie up books that could be used by someone smarter.

It's for loafing around in, not loafing around around. So you may just want to enter it.

You don't want or need to go back to Ed Dunn's right now. Maybe you could visit the Sneeds, instead.

Nothing like that is here.

Dee and Dee are off for some surprising and unexpected stuff beyond their house.

You don't see anything specific, but you remember Wendee passionately arguing that drawing out your e's might help in more ways than you think.

Wes is off visiting various places, nearby ones first, then the least twisty routes.
>p

>sneeds
It's the Sneeds'! You can enter if you've done all you want to. They'll be glad to see you no matter how much scenery you've found.

The door to the Sneed house is here to enter, now or later.
>x door
This door was made for knockin'!

[All commands are case insensitive]

The six directions, abbreviated: N, S, E, W, U, D. K knocks. I/IN goes in (inventory doesn't change much so I trumps INVENTORY when you can enter.)
B=brief V=verbose C=this command I=inventory X examines list unless an entry is present
F=friends left FF=friends in header O=one line of by-length list OO=one line in header
H=hint, HH=toggle hints the game gives when you're stuck
P pushes the panic button to send you to sector 444. R shows the nearest, first-in-alphabet unvisited place, R # (up to 9) shows the next 9.
J=jump mode to toggle diagonal warning.
T toggles big long listing in the status bar. X (#) reads one line, X (24) reads (for example) lines 2-4.
Z waits.

Typing no command circles through some of the nearer places you still need to visit.
