You accept the twist-o-scope, which hooks up to your list and adds some new information to it. Then the guy mumbles something about proprietary copyrights, snatches the scope back and runs away.

"Here's your adrift-a-tron. It'll tell you when you're hopelessly wandering." [NOTE: you can X IT right now, or X TRON.]

>x it
It is lightweight, totally inexplicable to someone from 20 years ago much less 87 (technology, boy,) and indicates it has 10 charges left, a charge being used when you get lost. Also you can turn it off whenever, with no penalty. [FOURTH WALL NOTE: the command A is shorthand to activate it.]

>x it
It is lightweight, totally inexplicable to someone from 20 years ago much less 87 (technology, boy,) and indicates it has 10 charges left, and if it finds nothing, no charge is used. [FOURTH WALL NOTE: the command A is shorthand to activate it.]

There's somewhere to visit here! Are you sure you wish to potentially waste a charge? [Note: your current find won't be included in the total.]

Just before your availableometer makes a FOOMP, it shows the number 1. Guess there's only one path ahead from here.

You find a trash receptacle where you can recycle the availableometer.
